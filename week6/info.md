The Discovery Server in Fast DDS helps manage the discovery process by providing a centralized or distributed service that allows DDS participants (nodes or applications) to find each other. It maintains a registry of available participants and their associated information, making it easier for nodes to discover and communicate with one another.

In summary, Fast DDS Discovery Server is a part of the Fast DDS middleware that handles the discovery aspect of DDS communication, allowing distributed systems to dynamically discover and connect with each other in a flexible and scalable manner. Keep in mind that there may have been updates or changes to Fast DDS or its components since my last knowledge update, so it's a good idea to consult the official documentation for the most up-to-date information.
